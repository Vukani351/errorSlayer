## Roadmap


- Capture & Organize:
    - Automatic Error Capture: Identify common error messages from your code editor and automatically log them, including relevant file paths and lines.
    - Problem & Solution Pairing: Link the captured error to the resources (articles, docs) you used to fix it. Drag and drop articles, highlight relevant sections, or paste URLs.
    - Tag & Filter: Tag errors and solutions with labels like "difficult," "frequent," or "language." Filter your log by these tags for easier search and review.

- Learn & Retain:
    - Flashcard Maker: Generate spaced repetition flashcards based on your captured errors and solutions. Review them at your own pace to solidify your understanding.
    - Knowledge Nuggets: Extract key learning points from the linked resources and summarize them in concise, digestible chunks.
    - Visualizations: Create visual representations of error patterns and recurring themes, allowing you to identify trends and areas for improvement.

- Community & Collaboration:
    - Share & Learn: Share your captured errors and solutions anonymously with other developers in the community. Learn from their approaches and contribute your own expertise.
    - Mentorship Platform: Connect with senior developers for guided learning and 
    - problem-solving assistance.

- Gamification & Motivation:
    - Points & Badges: Earn points for capturing errors, using flashcards, and contributing to the community. Unlock badges for specific achievements and track your progress.
    - Leaderboards: See how you rank against other developers on the leaderboard for    learning and community engagement.
    - Addressing Additional Problems:

- Contextual Help: Offer hints and suggestions within your code editor based on the current line and potential error patterns.
Personalized Learning: Recommend relevant resources based on your past errors and learning progress.
- Time Management: Track time spent on debugging and learning, helping you identify areas for efficiency improvement.

Benefits:

- Reduced Time Spent: Spend less time searching for solutions and more time coding.
- Improved Knowledge Retention: Deepen your understanding of errors and retain solutions effectively.
- Boost Confidence: Tackle challenges with confidence, knowing you have a personalized knowledge repository.
- Community Support: Learn from and contribute to a supportive developer community.
Error Slayer! empowers junior developers to overcome challenges, learn from mistakes, and grow their skillset. Take control of your learning journey and slay those errors like a pro!
 
Note: This is a conceptual design. Implementation details and specific features can be further refined based on user feedback and technical feasibility.

I hope this gives you a starting point for developing your Chrome extension! Feel free to adapt and build upon this idea to create a tool that truly empowers your fellow junior developers.
